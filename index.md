bitcoin is **pretty bloody complex**.  All of a sudden you're expected to know about; game theory, 
economics, technology and cryptography just to figure out what's going on.

The good news is there's a truck load of content for you to consume as you fall deeper and deeper
into this new wonderland.

The bad news is that a "truck load" is a lot of content (see our further reading section for starters!). 

So this website is all about taking these concepts and trying to explain them thorugh a series of 
pictures and short stories.
